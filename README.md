# A .gitconfig You Can Port Over

### Dear Future Jenell,

Hey. You're probably going to want a cool `.gitconfig` when you get a new computer, whenever that is. The aim of this is to make sure you're constantly updating your gitconfig with all the cool `git` aliases you've got so that when you're all brand new and fancy, you've don't have to go get your old laptop just to have your nifty aliases. 

K. 

***Keep this updated***


Love, 

Jenell
